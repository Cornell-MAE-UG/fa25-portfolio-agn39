As our final wrench design, my partner (Navya Penati ngp42) and I iterated our design through testing different material choices and dimensions to create a working wrench design that fits all of the specified design requirements. This includes the factors of safety for strength, crack, and fatigue as well as the required electrical output of our chosen strain gauge. Details on our dimensions, material choice, and analysis using Ansys are described below:
